⁡⁢⁣⁢Css, Media Query Syntax and Usage⁡
Example:
⁡⁣⁣⁢a:⁡ ⁡⁣⁣⁢this targets all devices with min-width of 700px⁡
@media (min-width: 700px) {
  h1 {
    color: red;
}
or
@media all and (min-width: 700px) {
  h1 {
    color: red;
}

⁡⁣⁣⁢b: ⁡⁣⁣⁢this targets specific devices with min-400px and max-600px⁡
@media only screen and (min-width: 400px) and (max-width: 600px) {
  h1 {
    color: red;
  }
}

​‌‌‍‍Responsive Design Checklist

⁡⁣⁣⁢​1: Fluid Layouts: Does your content rearrange itself on different devices?

2: Images: Do your images maintain good aspect ratios on all devices? Are they appropriate sizes on each devices?

3: Text: Your text should be a 'comfortable' size with 'comfortable' spacing on every device. No hard and fast rule here, but generally, keep your body text around 16px, ano no more than 700px wide on any device.

4: Overflow: Nothing should overflow the screen (i.e cut-off images or text).

5: Full-width mobile content: As a general rule of thumb, don't show columns on mobile devices, and make everything 100% width of the screen.

6: General Useability: Are your buttons big enough to click on a mobile device? are the most important things showing first? i could get into a long checklist on this one, but just have a friend use your site on a mobile device and desktop device. They will quickly be able to notice anything that doesn't feel right.⁡
